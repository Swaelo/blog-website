					<h2>Pong Update 1</h2>
					<h5>12-Feb-2020</h5>
					<p>Today I've made a some big updates to the ball movement in my pong game.</br>
					Previously, I had a couple of float values (XDirection and YDirection) for tracking the balls trajectory in each direction.</br>
					Whenever the ball collided with something on the table, I would adjust these values accordingly, and then at the end of each game update I would offset the balls position with these values to move it around the table.</p>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/Swaelo/7d51dfb51a09b5bcabc8feb2632e9aa5.js"></script>
					<p>I have now added a rigidbody component to the ball which is now used to handle the balls movement.</br>
					To make changes to the balls direction and speed forces are now applied to this rigidbody component.</br>
					I have also made some changes in how the ball reacts when colliding with the paddles.</br>
					If the ball collides with a paddle and that paddle is moving, force is applied to the ball based on the movement direction of the paddle to change the balls vertical velocity.</br>
					If the paddle is not moving at all, a small random value is either added or taken away from the balls vertical velocity to add some randomness to the game.</p>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/Swaelo/88262209e3f56bc609c756d187bf44fe.js"></script>
					<p>Firstly, the small change of making small random adjustments to the balls vertical velocity when colliding with a stationary paddle prevents the game from reaching a kind of dead state if the ball is moving in a straight line and neither player wants to move their paddle.</br>
					Secondly, changing the vertical velocity of the ball based on the movement of the paddles adds a lot more depth to the game, allowing players to add spin to the ball, making it harder for their opponents to guess where the ball is going to go.</br>
					In my next update, I will be making some audio-visual updates to the game.</br>
					This will include some sound effects, particle effects, shader effects and possibly some music will be added to the game, so stay tuned.</p>
